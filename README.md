# The-Tech-Academy-CSharp-Coding-Projects

Some of my larger C# projects are contained in this repo.

BookDatabase is an app I was making that is similiar to the website Goodreads, and eventually evolved into the BookStore repo that would act as a website for a bookstore.

Insurance Quote is an app that would take inputted data, and output a quote for a customer's insurance rate.
